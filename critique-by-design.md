# Title
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

## Step two: the critique

Looking at the visualization from the article, it seemed very clear and had a good use of color. The problem was, I felt like it wasn’t telling a good story with the data. It just listed the cities with the highest and lowest vacancy rates. I wanted to show something useful, and I care a lot about social policy. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution

When I downloaded the data, I decided to play around with it first to see what the trends were and what all I could visualize. I made a bunch of visualizations in Tableau, starting with a scatterplot showing the relationship between median rent and vacancy rate. I made another one showing vacancy against median home values. Then I made a bar graph showing all the vacancy rates, a bar graph showing the number of vacant units in each city, and some stacked bar graphs showing common reasons for vacancy and how many homes are affected by each. 
One that was speaking to me was the bar graph showing the number of vacant units. I wanted to be able to show the number of homeless people in each city to show how we do have housing for everyone, but that wasn’t in the dataset. So, I chose a few specific cities, looked up their numbers, and added them to the graph in text form. I chose New York, since it had the most vacant units, Pittsburgh, since I live here, and Austin, because it was farther down the graph so the text wouldn’t be crowded together. I decided to go a little further with the title, calling it “We Have Enough Housing for Everyone.” I hoped that the title, combined with the numbers of vacant units, would tell a compelling story about society’s use of resources.

## Step four: Test the solution - Feedback

For the feedback session, I asked my group members which visualization they liked the best. All of them said the bar graph showing the number of vacant units was the most impactful. I checked with the professor that we were indeed allowed to tell a different story than the original visualization, which didn’t really have that opinionated title. The data shown was very simple, and I had already done a good bit of work on the visualization, so my group didn’t have many suggestions of things to change. They liked the way I had used a different color for the different common vacancy reasons. The one thing I wound up changing was adding the specific number of vacant units to the end of each bar, so you can tell without guessing from the column ticks below.


## Step five: build the solution
