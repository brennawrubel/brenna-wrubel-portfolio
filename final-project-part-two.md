# Wireframes / storyboards

This should be a link to the preview. If it doesn't work, I have shared the project with the Professor and TA.

# User research 

I interviewed several people at my dance club practice. A few of them work with data and Tableau as a job, so they were familiar with the field.

## Target audience

My ultimate target audience is housing policymakers, although American voters are another demographic that would be useful to reach.

## Interview script

I want to make sure the draft is solid before I get into the final details. 
My questions are:

Was there a clear storyline?
Is there anything you think I should add or subtract?
Did you understand all the visualizations?

## Interview findings

The storyline was clear and flowed nicely.
The first visualization needs to be resized, the current sizing cuts off the bottom axis.
One person suggested a Prezi zoom in/out, although I don’t think that’s possible with Shorthand
The sizes of the circles in scatter plot were confusing, since I didn’t have the key listed. The person suggested I maybe just use dots instead of a scale by size.

# Identified changes for Part III

For Part III, I will resize the two visualizations at the beginning to make them easier to read. I will also change the last visualization to not have sized dots, because it doesn't add anything to the story.
I may also include on a final slide the calculations I did for the number of hours on minimum wage you would have to work to afford an apartment. I will see how much time I have after the I build a script and practice what I have now.
