# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

Since Part II, I incorporated feedback about visibility and adjusted the size of the visualizations to make sure the axes were visible. I added pictures ot the background of the title and conclusion slides, just to make everything look better.

I also created two different versions of the presentation, so that I could have one for the minute-long presentation and a more complete version for the final submission. For the final version, I added more context about the unaffordability of housing by highlighting my last visualization, which showed median rent prices. I included calculations showing how someone making minimum wage would be unable to realistically afford a place to live in any of the cities listed.

I considered adding a few more visualizations directly from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to flesh out the description of the homelessness crisis, but ulitmately decided against it because I felt like the focus of the presentation was more on the housing side than the homelessness side. Because of that topical focus, I changed the title from "Homelessness in the U.S." to "Housing and Homelessness in the U.S."

Finally, I decided that I needed a call to action that had a little more than 'think about the nature of the problem.' I decided to include a button link at the end to some solutions presented by Pro-Housing Pittsburgh, a non-profit advocacy group that focuses on affordable housing. They detail some of the specific zoning barriers to affordable housing that I felt were important, but not the topic of my presentation.  

## The audience
My main audience is local housing policy makers. I'm hoping to give them a sense of perspective as to the scale of the problem, in regards to both the magnitude of the homelessness crisis and the number of vacant units. 
I also hope that citizens looking to learn more about the homelessness crisis can use the presentation to get a sense of perspective and learn about some aspects of the problem. For Pittsburgh residents, I hope to use the link at the end to introduce them to a group working for more affordable housing.


# Final thoughts

I was fairly happy with the final result of my project. I like Shorthand as a way to visualize the scale of homelessness versus vacant housing. Particularly, I think the first two visualizations are powerful, with the slow fade transition where the homelessness bar shrinks to look small next to the number of vacant housing units. I've liked that graph from the beginning. It gives a nice shock start that catches the eye. However, I found Shorthand to be generally hard to work with. It's great if your material fits neatly within their existing tools. But, if you want to edit the size of something, it's basiclaly impossible. There just isn't enough control of the specific features. I feel like I'm not a great designer, so it was helpful to have some of the animations pre-built in a nice way, but it still didn't look the way I really wanted. Still, the data visualizations were there, and I think they told their stories well. 

During the final presentation, I felt pretty confident walking up, and was immediately startled by how sensitive the mouse was. It scrolled really fast, and I got thrown off of my rhythm because it brought up things too early and I had to go back. I wound up using the trackpad for more control, but I was a little bit jittery for the whole thing. It probably would have been easier with more time, since I would be able to breathe for a second before going back to my presentation rather than having to immediately move on.
