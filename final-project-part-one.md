# Outline - I have Chosen to Combine All These Sections Into One

For my project, I want to examine homelessness and housing vacancy in the U.S. I want to show that we have enough houses for everyone. I want to frame homelessness as a resource distribution problem, rather than an individual issue. 
To start, I will show a plain bar graph with the number of homeless individuals in the U.S. in 2023, using a point in time estimate from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Then, using the Shorthand animations, I will show the same graph but with the total number of vacant homes in 2023, using data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. There are around 700,000 homeless people, compared to about 15 million vacant homes. I want to leverage the shock value of seeing the homelessness bar shrink to show comparison to the number of vacancies.

After that, I plan to zoom in a little on individual cities. I will show my graph with the number of vacant units in the top 20 largest cities in the country. This is color-coded by the most common reason for vacancies, so I can use it to show that the main causes of home vacancies are renting and second/seasonal homes.

Next, I will highlight the unaffordability of housing, by showing a scatterplot of the median rent prices by vacancy rate for the top 50 largest cities. I will point out that none have a rent below $1,000 per month. I then plan to show the calculations for how many hours of a minimum wage job this takes to earn, compared to how many hours a 40-hour work week will give you per month.

I will use the data to argue that homelessness is a societal failure, not an individual one. Resource scarcity is an issue, but it’s not this issue.
